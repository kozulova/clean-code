# 🧼 Clean Code vs ⚡ Performant Code in JavaScript

This repository contains a set of JavaScript code examples that compare **clean**, **performant**, and **balanced** coding styles for common programming tasks. The goal is to explore the trade-offs between **readability**, **testability**, and **performance**.

## 📁 Contents

- [`average-of-evens.js`](./average-of-evens.js)  
  Find the average of even numbers in a large array.

- [`count-occurrences.js`](./count-occurrences.js)  
  Count how often each letter appears in an array of 100,000 random letters.

  Find the maximum number in an array of random numbers.

Each file includes:

- ✅ A **clean** implementation (using `.reduce()` or `.filter()`).
- ⚡ A **performant** version (using optimized loops).
- 🔁 A **balanced** version (improved speed without sacrificing clarity
